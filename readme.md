# Cards Game

## Launch

Point your `HttpServer` to the `app/` folder. Alternatively, just open `app/index.html` in your browser.

## Notes

App persists its state in `localStorage` so you won't loose progress on page reload. You can reset the `current cards` by clicking on the red `reset` button. It won't reset anything besides `cards`. The `highScore` will show up after the first game session completed. The game can make some sound so be prepared to that.

## Difficulty

To adjust difficulty, change `DIFFICULTY` constant in `app/js/constants` - it could be in the range of `[0...10]`. By default, the difficulty is `0` - only two types of cards is available, otherwise the game could become really hard and not very pleasant. Might be easily tuned to `unique card pairs` as stated in the task by setting the `DIFFICULTY` constant to `10`.

## Cheats

The app implements `momento` design pattern which means you can have `undo`/`redo` functionality. To get `the god mode cheat`, type the next `Konami` code:

```
up up down down left right left right b a
```

You should hear `evil laugh` sound and the appropriate buttons will show up on the right of the `red reset button`. You can travel back in time now with limit of `10` hops.

## Development

In your terminal:

```
[sudo] npm install
```

Then launch webpack:

```
webpack
```

It will take care about `building` the app and assets.

Please use `--production` argument with `webpack` command to make a production bundle.

If you want to use [LiveReload](https://github.com/livereload/LiveReload) instead of `webpack-dev-server`, run in your terminal:

```
gulp
```

Note that you need [LiveReload Browser Extention](http://livereload.com/extensions/) for auto reloads in your browser.

Point your `HttpServer` to the `app/` folder and open the specific `url` in your browser.
